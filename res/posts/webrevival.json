The owner is very friendly and they are very talented at art.\n<a href=\"https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about\">low tech magazine</a> run a website powered entirely on solar panels. They have a lot of really cool sustainability related content and i always love reading it.\ni hope you consider making your own content on the internet because every day it is becoming more corporatized and used as a marketing tool. thanks for reading <3",
