It's pretty widely assumed that he was killed by the authorities holding him there, but it was ruled a suicide in court 2 years later.\nhe was a father to 47 children, loved guns, loved minors (he was a libertarian so obviously he slept with minors), and loved drugs. and possibly selling drugs.\n<img src=\"/mcafee/JDM_0032.jpg\">",
